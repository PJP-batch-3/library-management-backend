While similar to Gone Girl, it was not as rich in character development. I found it difficulty to care about the fate of any of the main characters.  I suspected "the twist"about halfway through. Normally, this would not have been a problem had the writing and characters been more compelling. Still, it''s probably a matter of taste.');

Was often hard to put down!');

Its being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, but thats not a good comparison. They are both amazing in their own ways and for very different reasons. This book has so many questions that have to be answered. Is Megan dead or did she run away? Both are plausible. Why is Rachel so obsessed with her? Is it just her imagination? Why is Tom so passive of Rachels constant intrusions? Who is sleeping with who? Does Anna have any redeeming qualities?The characters are flawed and some are downright detestable. The story focuses on three women: Rachel, the drunk who cant let go of her ex-husband, Anna, the one who stole him away, and Megan, the beautiful missing woman.Rachel was a great character to read. She is completely broken and her only escape is with alcohol. The story is told from first-person perspective and doesnt have a whole lot of dialogue, so her chapters were desperate and lonely. I could put myself in her shoes. She is someone who is easy to pity, as she travels the train everyday, pretending to go to a job that she was fired from months ago. Every day she looks at a house, only a few down from where she once lived, and watches a loving couple. She creates a make-believe world around them, perfect in every way. Its an obvious set-up for disappointment.Anna is not likeable. At no point in the book did I feel anything for her but contempt. She knowingly begins an affair with a married man, none other than Rachels husband Tom, and effectively steals him away. Granted, Rachels depression makes it easy for her. At one point, while shes admiring her and Toms sleeping baby, she remembers the days of sneaking around with him and admits that she misses being a mistress. She loved the sense of danger and wishes she could go back to it. All she feels towards Rachel is disgust. She was a good chunk of the book and suffice it to say that her chapters filled me with my own sense of disgust, aimed at her.Next is Megan, the one Im not sure how to feel about. Partly, she reminds me of Anna, with her I dont care about anyone but me attitude, but she also reminds me of Rachel, with her struggle against depression and insomnia. Her tragic past is the only part of her character that I could stand, as the rest of the time shes thinking purely about herself and her memories of when she ran an art gallery and had men drooling over her. Surely, she would be appalled to be compared to Rachel, who is described as being overweight, drunk, and repulsive. Megans selfishness is sometimes nauseating, but then a wee bit of humanity shines through. Ultimately, I felt sorry for her, but I didnt like her.The men in the story are a puzzle. Theres good and bad. Its a confusing mess and I wasnt always sure which man I was reading about through these womens thoughts. Have no fear, the book did not leave me with a total sense of hopelessness concerning men in general, even though the author did not show them in a positive light.Its definitely a mystery. I had inklings all the way through, but it wasnt until about seventy percent through that I said, Ah-ha! Im always impressed with a book that can keep me guessing more than halfway through and this one definitely did. It wasnt a huge surprise to me, but it was an unpleasant one. In the beginning, everything is up in the air. No one is safe from doubt, not even poor Rachel. Nothing is completely settled until the very end, as it should be, leading to a perfectly short and powerful climax.The end was fulfilling, yet a little disappointing. I do not like happy-happy endings, but this one lacked hope. It was hinted at, but only one of these women gets to speak and her thoughts are still terrified and troubled. I would have liked to see more resolution for her. As it was, it felt sort of incomplete. My takeaway is that everyone lives in their own distorted version of reality and when the truth shows up it can have devastating repurcussions. So, dont lie and don t cheat.For the rating:Genre and general reading age  its a mystery and thriller. Reading age is adult, due to some really difficult scenes and references, including excessive drinking by more than one of the characters. Sometimes I wondered how they were able to stand up.The level of sexuality  for the amount of cheating involved, it was surprisingly mild. There werent actual sex scenes, but memories of trysts and a morning after.Was there graphic language? Not much.Did I cry? Nope.Is it part of a series? Nope.Level of character development was very high. Out of the three men and three women who make up the story, only one was a bit weak. The others were strong and I could see them in my mind.Did I laugh? Nope.This was a fantastically-written story and once I picked it up I couldnt put it down, literally. I stayed up late into the night with this one. Im happy to give it <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>.5 stars. It was almost perfect.');

I read a lot and love suspense thrillers. I loved how fast paced this book was. I didn''t get bored. I can usually guess the ending of movies and books pretty quickly but this one took me for a spin! It was exhilarating! I typically don''t like when authors go back and forth between characters. If I can''t read it in one setting going back and forth gets confusing. Because of how faced paced and exciting this book is I didn''t have that problem. I was able to stay interested from the first page until the last. I was able to keep up with each character and loved how each one developed as you go through it. I felt like I was right there with Rachel through all her flashbacks. Definitely a best seller! Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer! Can''t wait to see the movie when it comes out. I will be adding Paula to my list of favorite authors too!');

Instead I found it to be a bit shallow in terms of the plot and character development. It wasn''t clear why the police kept on jumping from one suspect to another without really having reasonable leads or evidence... and why certain characters were introduced and portrayed the way they were (other than to mislead the reader). It was a quick read though... and worth reading if one is planning to watch the movie.');

I was disappointed in that there wasn''t enough character development. All the females in this book are portrayed as weak and all the male characters as controlling.

Who, instead of killing the person who has figured it out, incredulously decides to confess to them everything they did and why they did it?  It is that cliched plot device that gives the cornered "good guy" the opportunity and the time to thwart the "bad guy."  It is lazy and uninspired writing, and it left me feeling cheated.This book commits the cardinal sin of writing.  It tells the story instead of showing the story. I''d wait for the next train if I were you.');

I do not ask for much in my beach reads: plot, some coherent writing, character development. I gave this book more than a fair shot. But I''m stopping at page 175.Poor writing, flat characters, and the author''s sexist tone seeps off every page. Every female psychosis is on display here: dressing the part, feeling worthless, feeling like a child, sexual motivation behind how men act, women''s revenge, "I''m a force to be reckoned with," "all these men," the list goes on....I can''t take it anymore. Life is too short to read bad books like this one.I hate it1/5 Goodreads1/5 Amazon');

Author, Paula Hawkins had me spell bound. Her writing is fierce - she certainly knows how to spend a very suspenseful tale, keeping the reader quickly turning the pages despite ALL of her very unlikeable characters.Rachel is Tom Watson''s ex-wife. She is quite pathetic. She''s a drunk and unemployed. But each morning she rides the train to London (to save face) pretending she''s just another commuter. And the train always stops very near her old house where she was happy and hopeful with Tom. A few doors down live a beautiful couple that she''s dubbed "Jess and Jason." She imagines their life together, giving them wonderful attributes and marriage. Looks can be deceiving as the real "Jess" - Meagan - shows us. Tom''s current wife hates Rachel and truly believes that Tom''s ex-wife is unstable and dangerous to her, Tom, and their baby daughter. Everything is going as smoothly as each woman''s situation can go until one of them suddenly disappears. Rachel must interject herself in the investigation. After all, she''s invested a year of mornings and evenings watching this woman. Bad decision, girlfriend.The story line is told from each of the three women''s altering POV, and that technique is powerful and makes the novel work. As I''ve said there is not one redeemable or likeable character in the whole book, but the reader is also a Rachel - a voyeur of a sort like in "Rear Window." Something bad has happened and we know it''s coming and we can''t shut our eyes. We readers must know what happened and by whose hands.');

Nor am I happy with authors who use something like psychology and/or addiction to get the character to do something totally brain-dead.  This author used both.  This is one of those stories that would be an essay if the heroine just used some common sense (just a teeny bit of common sense!) in the first chapter.  In addition, I didn''t like a single character in the book and was severely tempted to stop reading it, but I knew I wanted to write a review, so I must read the whole thing.  The character closest to likable was Cathy, who was super-nice and a major enabler of Rachel''s psychological and addiction problems--basically a doormat and doing all the wrong things.');

The book uses Gone Girl''s technique of using different POVs, and unreliable narration which I love. The story is engrossing and characters well-developed.HOWEVER:The pacing gets slow towards the middle, and becomes a positive drag towards the end.
